# What is Stacks Core Eng?:

Stacks Core Eng is a collective term that encompasses the vital participants to the Nakamoto Release, sBTC, Clarity VM, and Testing & Hardening initiatives. The contributors to these initiatives play a crucial role in designing, developing, supporting, and ensuring the security of blockchain, sBTC-related initiatives, and the associated infrastructure, programming & management that brings this technology to life.

# What is Stacks Core Eng North Star?:

Stacks contributors are committed to propelling the Bitcoin economy forward. Currently, Stacks Core Eng is focused on reaching a TVL of 10,000 BTC within the sBTC protocol three months after the launch of The Nakamoto Release. This ambitious objective will strengthen the Bitcoin ecosystem and increase the utility of Bitcoin as an asset.
