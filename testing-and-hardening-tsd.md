# Testing and Hardening | Technical Specification Document

# Executive Summary:

>ðŸ‘‰ At a high-level what is Testing & Hardening - its purpose, target audience, and benefits?

The Testing & Hardening initiative is a strategic effort targeting developers and maintainers to enhance the Stacks blockchain's functionality and user experience. By introducing innovative black-box testing methodologies and optimizing test execution on pull requests, the initiative aims to detect bugs early, reduce critical issues during updates, and create a secure and stable blockchain ecosystem. Through this project, we seek to bolster the reliability of the stacks blockchain, *during either updates to the protocol, or non-consensus updates to the stacks-node,* ensuring a seamless experience for users and a smoother development process.

**Definition:**
The Testing & Hardening initiative aims to enhance the functionality and user experience of interacting with the Stacks blockchain and its codebase. It focuses on improving the testing framework to prevent frequent bugs during protocol updates and non-consensus changes to the stacks-node, ultimately leading to a more secure and reliable blockchain ecosystem.

**Purpose:**
The initiative seeks to address the high occurrence of bugs discovered during Stacks releases, as witnessed in the recent 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 updates. By enhancing the testing framework, the goal is to catch these bugs early on and reduce the number of critical issues that arise during rapid succession releases.

**Target Audience:**
The Testing & Hardening initiative targets developers, maintainers, and contributors of the Stacks blockchain and its codebase. Additionally, it benefits end-users by providing a more stable and robust blockchain system.

**Benefits:**
The proposed improvements in the testing framework offer several benefits:

1. **Bug Detection:** The introduction of new black-box testing methodologies will help identify bugs, including those not impossibly complex, thereby minimizing the likelihood of critical issues.
2. **Enhanced PR Evaluation:** The initiative aims to improve the current state of automatic test execution on the stacks-blockchain repository, making it easier to evaluate whether a given PR has sufficient test coverage.
3. **Faster Test Execution:** Reducing the overhead of running a full suite of tests on pull requests will speed up test execution and streamline the development process.

# Problem Statement:

>ðŸ‘‰ What specific problem does The Testing & Hardening initiative solve?

The Testing & Hardening initiative aims to address the significant problem of the current testing regime for the Stacks blockchain being inadequate in detecting and preventing numerous critical bugs that surfaced during the release of Stacks 2.1 and subsequent versions (2.1.0.0.1, 2.1.0.0.2, 2.1.0.0.3, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4). 

The rapid discovery of these bugs and the subsequent need for critical updates highlight the urgency to enhance the testing framework. By implementing new black-box testing methodologies and optimizing test execution on pull requests, the initiative seeks to fortify the blockchain's reliability, reducing bugs, and ensuring a more stable and secure blockchain ecosystem.

# Solution:

>ðŸ‘‰ *How does the* Testing & Hardening *initiative provide a solution to the identified problem?*

The Testing & Hardening initiative proposes a multi-pronged solution: implement effective black-box testing to detect bugs and improve test execution for pull requests.

First, itâ€™s important to note that these bugs werenâ€™t missed for lack of tryingâ€” some bugs are unavoidable, but these bugs are mostly not impossibly complex, and so its reasonable to think that some kind of testing would have caught them. For these kinds of bugs, black-box testing is very well suited to uncovering them. So, the first prong of this work is to implement sufficient black-box testing that these bugs would have been discovered (this is a kind of meta-regression testing).

Second, for PRs, it is currently very difficult to evaluate whether or not a given PR has sufficient testing coverage. The current state of automatic test execution in the stacks-blockchain repository is such that test runs take alogn time, if they complete at all, and provide unclear test coverage results. This framework must be improved if PR reviews are expected to uncover code that is lacking in test coverage.

# Technical Requirements:

>ðŸ‘‰ *What technical requirements and criteria must the Testing & Hardening initiative meet to be fully functional and successfully implemented?*


This workstream must produce source code and documentation for executing black box testing on the stacks-blockchain which would catch each of the aforementioned bugs.

# Architectural Diagrams:

A detailed discussion outlining various black-box testing methods and their potential application to the stacks-blockchain can be found in this link: **[GitHub Discussion Link](https://github.com/stacks-network/stacks-blockchain/discussions/3732)**.

# Testing Plan:

>ðŸ‘‰ *What is the comprehensive testing plan in place to ensure quality assurance?*

The Testing & Hardening initiative itself serves as a comprehensive testing plan.

# Deployment Plan:

>ðŸ‘‰ *What does the deployment plan entail, including infrastructure requirements, deployment processes, and monitoring strategies?*

Improvements to the stacks-blockchain testing architecture may involve moving from Github actions or Github actionâ€™s default runners. However, initially, this testing workstream should focus on continued usage of Github actions for automated tests.

For non-CI tests (i.e., black-box testing like fuzz testing), these tests should run on long-standing executors (because they may need to run for longer), and should be triggered for runs before releases.
